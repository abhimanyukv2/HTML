<p>If you just put all the content in an HTML file with no markup, it just end up as one big blob on the website. The browser assumes its all one long string of text.</p>

<p>We can try to create seperate paragraphs by leaving a bunch of space in our HTML file, but that space doesn't count. The simple brwser ignores it. All these words simply add up to a bunch of words in a row.</p>

<p>The browser doesn't know what this is, because we haven't used any HTML yet to tell it what this is.</p>
