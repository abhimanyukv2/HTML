<p>This is paragraph of text. Let's pretend it's part of a long article, where we except many people to quickly scan through it, and <b>we want to mark certain phrases with some boldness</b>, some visual attention, so that those sentence jump out and people don't miss them. Almost like having a pull-quote.</p>
