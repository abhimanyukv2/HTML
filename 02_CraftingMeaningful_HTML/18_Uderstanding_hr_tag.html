    <h1>How We Make Our Olive Oil</h1>
    <p>Cultivating: Our olive trees are diligently pruned, watered, and monitored for pests while the fruit is growing. In addition, we apply organic farming techniques to ensure we can carry the “organic” label.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Harvesting: We harvest the greener, more unripe olives, to preserve quality and nutritional value. Harvesting is carried out by hand shaking the trees, or by using the newer mechanical harvesters, with the main goal of preventing damage to the fruit.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Cleaning:  Within twelve hours of picking, harvested olives are transported to the mill where they are dropped into a hopper and move along a conveyor belt to be washed, sorted, and cleaned of branches and leaves.</p>
